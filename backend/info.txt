File: app.js - main file of the backend, creates the Express.js app

Folder: routes
  File: oldroutes.js - serves archival purposes for developers only
  File: p_routes.js - hold all publisher routes
    * all routes in this file begin with /pub which is specified in app.js
    * this takes care of the web portal and rendering the html pages
    * Routes
      * GET /pub - publisher login page with form switch to register(?)
      * GET /pub/login - signs in publisher and takes to new message page
      * POST /pub/register - registers publishers
      * GET /pub/:username/new-message - renders new message form
      * POST /pub/:username/new-message - validates new message form values, sends to db
  File: r_routes.js - holds all reader routes
    * serves as default routes, if /pub is not specified the backend
      defaults to reader routes
    * Routes - every request should result in a status code being returned
      with 200 = okay, 400/404 = invalid request, and 500 = system error
      * GET "/login/:username-:password" - basic login
      * POST "/register/:username-:password-:email" - new reader
        returns
      * use (any action) "/delete/:username-:password" - should catch get and
        post requests of this form - drops this reader from reader table
      * GET "/message/:cat-:datetime-:lat-:log"
          - cat is category id or "ALL"
          - datetime should be in format "YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI"
            where HH24 is the hour out of 24 or "NOW" if no time given
            and I will get current system datetime.
      * POST /:username/addCat/:cat (???) - if we are letting users subscribe to
        categories then this will add to the ReaderCategory table
        POST /location/:username/:lat-:long - updates location in database
      * In development *
