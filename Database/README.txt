I followed this post to insert pics or videos in the database:

The only problem is that I don't think we should insert the pics locally in the database. We should use the backend for that, I guess.
If you have any question, just ask me.

I've included 3 different places: 1 college park, 2 baltimore and 2 michigan. Different topics: Restaurant, Sports, Life, University
